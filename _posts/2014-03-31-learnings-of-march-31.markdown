### Hey Ian, whad'ya learn today?

That extracting a thorny view/controller combo to [a Presenter](http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2011-09-09-better-ruby-presenters) is painful the first time. But the end result is always worth it.

That two pepole probably sholudn't separately refactor the same code at the same time. Unless you love merge conflicts, I guess.

That I should always practice presentations before giving them. Which I am doing this time. I just should have done this all the other times.

Sadly I didn't write any interesting code today, just merged up stuff that I'd already written. So no cool examples to show off.
