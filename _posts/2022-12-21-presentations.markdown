# Presentations

I've given a lot of presentations over the years and it's something I really enjoy doing. I realized that I'd shared some of these, but not all of them. I thought it would be nice to gather them all in one post.

There are other talks that aren't here, either because they weren't recorded or those videos have been lost to time.
