Hello, DiR readers!

There will be a full newsletter post in the near future, but I wanted to break radio silence to send you a few links and hopefully meet some of you at RubyConf.

- My talk from Rocky Mountain Ruby is available on Confreaks
- I did a quick examination of an Exercism problem in Rust
- Over a couple of posts, I've dived deeper into an Exercism problem with Rust. Part One and Part Two
- Avdi Grimm has a great newsletter that is far more frequent than mine. You should check it out.

Now, on to the social stuff! I, along with my co-workers, are at RubyConf this year. Are you? Want to go get a drink/dinner/lunch/hallway coffee/etc? My main goal here is to meet and talk to other Rubyists, so let's do that! You can reply to this email, send me a note [@iwhitney](https://twitter.com/iwhitney) on twitter or email me at ian@ianwhitney.com.

Until next time, true receivers!

Ian
