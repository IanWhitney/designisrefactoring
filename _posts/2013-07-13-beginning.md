A few years ago I had to implement some securty feature, it had to
integrate with some Java platform or had XSLT or something...I forget. I couldn't
figure it out, the documentation was opaque and all the blog posts on
the subject were unhelpful, dry and lacked any sense of community.

I bemoaned the state of these blogs to some co-workers. In the Ruby
world, I said, I could search almost any problem and find a helpful,
educational and fun blog post written by "some hipster kid holding a can of PBR."

Well, I'm not young and I don't drink PBR, but I might as well have a
Ruby blog. Energized both by the [Ruby Rogues](http://rubyrogues.com/112-rr-community-hacks/) and my upcoming change of employers, I decided to get a blog rolling.

For ease of use I went with [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) and [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/). This may change if I find some technology I want to dig into, but I've been around enough blogging platforms (e.g., I helped Blogger buy a real server back in 2000) to know that lightweight and easy is what I want. Jekyll Bootstrap certainly seems to fit this bill.

Ok, introduction out of the way. Up next, some thoughts on [Readme
Driven Development](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html), about which I'll be presenting to [Ruby.MN](http://ruby.mn/) in a couple of weeks. That presentation, should you care to run it yourself in [Reveal.JS](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/), is [here](https://github.com/IanWhitney/rdd_presentation).
